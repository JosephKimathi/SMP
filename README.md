The main program is named SMP.java, with the other java files as data structures
In the resources folder, dev.txt and client.txt are present and are used for reading in developers and contracts respectively. Unfortunately some of the syntax is sensitive.

dev.txt format:
Dev's name, years of exp, array of languages, hours worked per day, start date: dd/mm/yyyy, end date: dd/mm/yyyy, rate of pay

client.txt format:
Description, array of languages for tech stack, start date:dd/mm/yyyy, end date: dd/mm/yyyy, rate of pay

NB: array of languages must not have spaces within the array
eg: [python,java,c]
